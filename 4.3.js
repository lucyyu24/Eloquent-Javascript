4.3 A list

Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures. 
A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with the array). 
A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to the third, and so on.

Write a function arrayToList that builds up a data structure like the previous one when given [1, 2, 3] as argument, and write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. 
Also write the helper functions prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position
in the list, or undefined when there is no such element.
If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
